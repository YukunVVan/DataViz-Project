# [](#header-1)Objectives
Assess the success of programs with the police or the justice system in terms of public responses
Analyze sentiments on Twitter with spatio-temporal analyses
Introduction
BetaGov is working with a large number of police departments across the United Stated, several of which are implementing interventions aimed at improving police-community relations. In this context, good outcome measures are hard to find: generally, the response can be reported by a communityâ€™s representative, or by the media if the policy implemented is of sufficient impact, but these reports may be biased.

This project will work to assess the viability of social media, particularly twitter, as a meter to measure the response of the population to policy implementation in the prosecutorial justice sector.

Starting with a body of tweets collected ahead of the capstone, the team will investigate strategies to collect samples of relevant tweets. Using natural language processing (NLP) and working with police departments, as well as with prosecutorial justice entities, the team will assess whether it is possible to establish a baseline for the sentiment about police and justice departments across the United States. The team will deliver a sentiment map, assessing the geographical variations of the baseline sentiment. The sentiment across the USA wand in specific counties will be measured longitudinally. The USA general signal will then be removed from the local time series to reveal trends and changes in response to relevant social events and to the implementation of the BetaGov pilots.
